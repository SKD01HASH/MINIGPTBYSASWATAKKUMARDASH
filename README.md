## About BigramGpt

BigramGpt is a project inspired by the remarkable work of Dr. Andrej Karpathy, whose insightful YouTube video[https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY] served as a guiding light in my journey. This implementation builds upon the foundation established in the video and introduces several enhancements that make it unique.

With the integration of an external bigram language model, MiniGPT offers enhanced performance and efficiency. Additionally, I have developed my very own GPT model from scratch, taking it a step further than the tutorial. These modifications set this implementation apart and demonstrate my creativity and understanding of the underlying concepts.

## Key Features

- Integration of an external bigram language model for enhanced performance.
- Development of a unique GPT model from scratch, showcasing my expertise and creativity.
- Well-documented codebase for easy understanding and further development.
- Pickle model provided for convenient usage and experimentation.
